## Movie Data
### Write a program that uses a structure named MovieData to store the following information about a movie:
- Title
- Director
- Year Released
- Running Time (in minutes)
### The program should create two MovieData variables, store values in their members, and pass each one, in turn, to a function that displays the information about the movie in a clearly formatted manner.

### Modify the Movie Data program written for Programming Challenge 1 to include two additional members that hold the movie’s production costs and first-year revenues. Modify the function that displays the movie data to display the title, director, release year, running time, and first year’s profit or loss.
