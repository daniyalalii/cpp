## Customer Accounts
### Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data about a customer account:
```bash 
Name
Address
City, State, and ZIP
Telephone Number
Account Balance
Date of Last Payment
```
### The program should use an array of at least 10 structures. It should let the user enter data into the array, change the contents of any element, and display all the data stored in the array. The program should have a menu-driven user interface.
```
Input Validation: When the data for a new account is entered, be sure the user enters
data for all the fields. No negative account balances should be entered.
